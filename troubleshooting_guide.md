# Troubleshooting Guide

To help diagnose what isn't working, please provide more specific information about the issue you're encountering:

1. What specific operation is failing? (e.g., exporting messages, formatting texts, combining files)

2. Are you seeing any error messages? If so, please share them.

3. What steps are you taking when the issue occurs?

4. What is the expected behavior vs what actually happens?

Based on the codebase, here are the main components that could potentially have issues:

- Message Export: The imessage-exporter command might fail if paths or permissions are incorrect
- File Processing: Issues could occur when reading/writing message files
- Contact Management: Problems could arise with contact information handling
- Data Formatting: Message chunking or formatting might not work as expected

Please provide more details about which of these areas is problematic, and I can help identify and fix the specific issue.
