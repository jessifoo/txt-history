This is a script: format_txt_history_full.py which runs on cli 
it automatically spins up a venv and installs requirements.py
it cleans up the venv at the end 

it is run by

```Bash
python3 format_txt_history_full.py -s 0.5 -d "2024-01-01" -l 500 -n "Robert"

-s: size (mb) per chunk
-d: date
-l: lines per chunk (this or -s, not both)
-n: name

```
All are optional and if none are supplied only the name "Phil" is used by default

This means it will lool up phil's phone number and then search imessage_exporter by using both his phone number and his email

it will then format the messages and remove anything I don't want from imessage layout such that the result is:

Sender (my number is always changed to Jess), Datetime, Message

I expect to get a txt file with a line space between each row
and a csv file of the same name with no line spacing

example

chunk_1.txt
```Bash

Phil, Jan 20, 2025 12:21:19 PM, Yea, I’ll have to go to bed earlier

Jess, Jan 20, 2025 12:22:28 PM, When she’s healthy, she doesn’t wake up, I don’t know if she’s getting sick, but in general let her work on falling back to sleep herself. Robert and Roxanne did it, I’m sure we can too

Phil, Jan 20, 2025  2:26:27 PM, Are you picking up Everly?

Jess, Jan 20, 2025  2:26:36 PM, Yes

Phil, Jan 20, 2025  3:43:40 PM, I’m going to stop by the barber to get my hair cut, then I’ll come home. How’s Everly doing?

Phil, Jan 20, 2025  3:56:56 PM, Barber was busy, coming home now

Jess, Jan 20, 2025  8:35:08 PM, I like how she was the one who initiated her bedtime routine with the reading kind of - it was you that could tell that’s what she wanted and that is phenomenal attunement, you’re impressively good at it when you let yourself be. She’s done that before and I haven’t taken it as seriously but I want to be better at that. She’s actually a fairly responsible and intuitive baby haha

Phil, Jan 20, 2025  8:37:09 PM, Haha yea it feels good when it’s effortless

Jess, Jan 20, 2025 11:52:58 PM, Apparently my payment didn’t go through, Can I borrow $300 to meet my overdue payment and I need to pay my car insurance. I’m sorry. I don’t know how this happened

Phil, Jan 20, 2025 11:53:31 PM, 300 total?

Jess, Jan 20, 2025 11:53:58 PM, Yes, $200 to get access to my insurance account again and pay the overdue amount and then $95 or something for registration before end of the month

Jess, Jan 20, 2025 11:54:14 PM, Meant registration first time

Phil, Jan 20, 2025 11:55:09 PM, Sent

Do not change the phone numbers that are in the script, ever
do not change how the imessage_exporter command is run with it's specific arguments
Do not change the expected output files

Optimize the way we get from the input cli command to the output files
Think step by step and show your reasoning, explain to me why you are making the change you are making and teach it to me so I understand
